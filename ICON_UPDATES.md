# Icon Updates - Texas Heritage Theme

## Overview
Updated all icons throughout the application to better match the historical and cultural themes of East Texas heritage. All icons are sourced from **Lucide React**, a high-quality, MIT-licensed icon library that's already integrated into the project.

## Why Not a Separate Texas Icon Library?
After researching available packages on npm, there is no comprehensive, free Texas-specific icon library available. Instead, we've carefully selected appropriate icons from Lucide React that represent:
- **Texas geography**: Pine trees, wheat fields, rural landscapes
- **Historical periods**: Tents (indigenous), settlers, agriculture, industry
- **Heritage architecture**: Landmarks, churches, schools, factories
- **Community values**: Libraries, education, preservation

## Icon Design Rationale

### Theme: East Texas Heritage & Rural History

1. **Geographic Authenticity**
   - `TreePine`: East Texas is known as the "Piney Woods" region
   - `Wheat`: Major agricultural region (cotton, grain, crops)

2. **Historical Accuracy**
   - `Tent`: Indigenous peoples' traditional structures
   - `Factory`: Post-Civil War industrial development
   - `Train`: Railroad expansion shaped the region

3. **Cultural Significance**
   - `Library`: Preservation of knowledge and history
   - `School`: Community education and growth
   - `Landmark`: Historic courthouses and civic buildings
   - `Church`: Central role of faith communities

4. **Visual Consistency**
   - All icons from single library (Lucide React)
   - Consistent stroke width and style
   - Professional, minimal aesthetic
   - High accessibility standards
